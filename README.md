This is a Bash scrip that automatically sets up and configures Linux systems to run a Logstash test with file input data in JSON format. The resulting data output is in CSV format.
Currently the Java setup is only suited for Debian distros. 
It will be adjusted to work on all Linux distros as soon as I have time to continue working on it. 

For now it is just work in progres ;)
